  abstract = {We approach the problem of stylistic motion synthesis by learning
	motion patterns from a highly varied set of motion capture sequences.
	Each sequence may have a distinct choreography, performed in a distinct
	sytle. Learning identifies common choreographic elements across sequences,
	the different styles in which each element is performed, and a small
	number of stylistic degrees of freedom which span the many variations
	in the dataset. The learned model can synthesize novel motion data
	in any interpolation or extrapolation of styles. For example, it
	can convert novice ballet motions into the more graceful modern dance
	of an expert. The model can also be driven by video, by scripts or
	even by noise to generate new choreography and synthesize virtual
	motion-capture in many styles.},

	geometry. One of the main uses of this robot is to be entertainment.
	Therefore it is important that the robot's motions are easily created,
	and feasible for the robot. Captured human motion data are used as
	a starting point, to which the following modifications are added:
	step length, speed, rotational angle during turn, and so on. Dynamic
	balance is also considered. Verification is conducted through both
	simulation and experiment with HRP-4C. A turning performance based
	on human motion is successfully demonstrated.},
