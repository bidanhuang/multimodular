  Abstract                 = {We approach the problem of stylistic motion synthesis by learning motion patterns from a highly varied set of motion capture sequences. Each sequence may have a distinct choreography, performed in a distinct sytle. Learning identifies common choreographic elements across sequences, the different styles in which each element is performed, and a small number of stylistic degrees of freedom which span the many variations in the dataset. The learned model can synthesize novel motion data in any interpolation or extrapolation of styles. For example, it can convert novice ballet motions into the more graceful modern dance of an expert. The model can also be driven by video, by scripts or even by noise to generate new choreography and synthesize virtual motion-capture in many styles.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents preliminary results on generating walking and turning motion of a humanoid robot based on human motion data obtained by using motion capturing system. The target humanoid robot is recently released HRP-4C, which looks like a Japanese woman with realistic geometry. One of the main uses of this robot is to be entertainment. Therefore it is important that the robot's motions are easily created, and feasible for the robot. Captured human motion data are used as a starting point, to which the following modifications are added: step length, speed, rotational angle during turn, and so on. Dynamic balance is also considered. Verification is conducted through both simulation and experiment with HRP-4C. A turning performance based on human motion is successfully demonstrated.},
