\section{Robot Experiment}
\label{sec:exp}

In the previous section we described the details of our multiple
module approach to manipulation task learning in a generic way. In this section,
we explain the experimental details for our application in the
bottle-opening task.  We demonstrate that the multiple module approach
is able to acquire human adaptive control policy and enable the robot
to master this manipulation task.

The proposed multiple module approach is implemented on a real robot system
--- the 7 DOF Light Weight KUKA robot arm\footnote{http://www.kuka-labs.com/en/medical\_robotics/lightweight\_robotics} and the 4 DOF Barrett Hand\footnote{http://www.barrett.com/robot/products-hand.htm}
%JJB citations %JJB ---
for a particular manipulation task: opening bottle caps. The target of
this task is to unscrew a tightened cap until it can be lifted from
the bottle. This task is chosen as it is a common task in human daily
life, and at the same time a
complex task from the control point of view. The friction between the
bottle and the cap plays an important role in the task: it largely
determines the exerted torque required to open the cap. However, the
friction, and the way it changes as the cap unscrews, varies
between different bottles.

Estimating the friction coefficient (FCO) solely according to the
material is difficult, as it is affected by many factors such as the
load force, movement velocity, contact surface situation, composition
of the material, temperature and
etc.~\citep{gustafssoninvestigation}. A deterministic control strategy
based on the value of FCO is not practical in this task. A small
estimation error in the FCO may produce either too small torque,
which leads to task failure, or too large torque, which may cause
hardware damage. Therefore an adaptive control strategy is desired for
this
task. %As it involves switching in multiple phases of friction, e.g. static friction and kinetic friction, a fast adaptive strategy is desired.
We use our multiple module approach to model the adaptive strategy.

%The proposed multiple model approach is implemented on a real robot system (the KUKA robot arm and the Barrett Hand) for a particular manipulation task: opening bottle caps. The target of this task is to unscrew a tighten cap.
%This task is chosen as it is a common task in human daily life and at the same time a complex one from the control point of view.
%Before the task begins, human does not possess any information about the tightness of the cap. This information can only be estimated once the task is started. During the task, human constantly update the motor commands, i.e. how much torque to apply to the cap and how much force to grip the cap, according to the sensory feedback. This plan can not be make in advance as the dynamic configuration of each bottle is different and it changes along the task process. The friction coefficient between the cap and the bottle is not trackable in literatures, , which varies by the composition of the material, load force, movement velocity, temperature and etc.~\citep{gustafssoninvestigation}. Human have to cope with these uncertainties and adapt to the changes. In the later sections, we will explain the experiment details and show that the multiple module approach is able to acquire human adaptive control policy and enable the robot to master this manipulation task.
%%For an object manipulation task, it is hard to simulate as it involve friction between objects. Therefore we implemented this system on a real robot, the KUKA robot arm mounted with the Barrett hand. The task we are looking at is opening bottle caps.

\subsection{Human demonstration and experimental setup}
\label{sec:exp_demo}
%Figure~\ref{setup} shows the setup of the human demonstration. %In this task we record 2 variables: the displacement of the cap and the torque driving the cap to run. We used the Optitrack motion tracking system to morning the position and orientation of the cap, a force torque sensor mounted on the bottle to measure the driving torque.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Dry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems which display a stable behavior in the absence of friction.
%\item For instance, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' of a glass harp,[33][34] phenomena which involve stick and slip, modeled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.[35]
%\item Lubricated friction/dry friction
%\item not always follow Coulomb's law
%\item extremely complicated physical interaction
%\item adhesive tape
%\end{itemize}

%Opening bottle cap is a common task for human however a difficult one for robot. The friction between the bottle and the cap, and the way they change from screwed to unscrewed, vary among different bottles. This requires multiple controlling strategies to open them. Hence a multiple modular approach is suitable for this task, which includes at lease two different control strategies for handling static friction and kinetic friction. Figure~\ref{fig:bottlepatterns} shows three different patterns of human control strategies for three different contexts.

% What does human do --
Opening a bottle cap is a common task for human but not an easy one
for robot. Before the task begins, the human does not possess any
information about the tightness of the cap. This information can only
be estimated once the task is started. During the task, a human will
constantly update the motor commands, i.e. how much torque to apply to
the cap and with how much force to grip the cap, according to the
sensory feedback. This plan can only be made in real time as the
contact surface condition changes along the task process. Humans have
to cope with these uncertainties and adapt to the
changes. Figure~\ref{fig:bottlepatterns} shows three different
patterns of human control strategies for three different
contexts. This task requires an adaptive strategy that controls the
turning torque, gripping force and the displacement of the
cap. Learning from human demonstration allows us to gain such a
control strategy without fully analyzing the dynamics of the whole
system. %JJB: "griping" is something else -- be sure you don't say
        %"griping" anywhere in your PhD!

%The task involves the control of the turning torque, griping force according to the displacement of the cap. As the contact surface condition is hard to estimate before starting the task, and changes of the friction coefficient (FCO) is nonlinear during the unscrewing process, it is hard to build an analytical model for this task. Human can easily open most of the bottles in daily life. Learning from human demonstration will allow us to gain a controlling strategy without writing the analytical expression of the dynamics of the whole system.

In each demonstration, data from first time a finger touches the cap
to when the cap is finally open and lifted was recorded. Opening a
bottle cap is a cyclic task. Each cycle includes three stages:
reaching, turning and releasing. In our experiments, four to six
cycles need to be completed to open the bottles. During the reaching
and releasing stages, neither torque nor gripping force is applied to the
cap and the cap remains still. During the turning stages, humans
continuously apply torque to the cap and it starts moving once the
friction is overcome.

  \caption{ \scriptsize{Exerted torque for opening three different bottles. \textcolor{red}{These three demonstrations show different control patterns. Significant differences can be observed from the first cycles. For the most difficult bottle b4 (blue), the torque reaches its peak and drop slowly until the end of the cycle. This shows the friction between the bottle and cap keep decreasing as the cap starts moving. For the easier bottle b2 (green), the torque drop straightly from its peak to a (relatively) constant value, which suggests that the friction remains constant when the cap is moving. For the b1 (red), the torque slowly climb to a top and drop sharply for a short while and then drop slowly. These different patterns indicate the different types of friction governing in different contexts.}}

\subsubsection{Demonstration in different task contexts}
\label{sec:exp_context}
In order to explore
different task contexts, we demonstrated the task with different
setups, which are the combination of four different plastic
bottles~($b1-b4$) and four different plastic caps~($c1-c4$)
(Figure~\ref{fig:b_c}). \textcolor{red}{The caps are made by light materials such that their masses and inertias can be neglected in the computation of motor commands.  The relationship of driving force/torque and mass/inertais is well studied. In this study, we focus on learning the strategies for handling friction, which is not well understood and hard to predict.} According to the surfaces condition of the
bottles and the caps, the difficulty of opening the bottles
varies. $b1-b4$ are labeled by increasing difficulty. The bottle $b1$
is the easiest one, which originally contained body lotion. We
lubricated bottle $b1$ with its body lotion to make it even easier. The
bottle $b4$ is the most difficult one; it originally contains honey
which is very sticky. We left honey on the surfaces of $b4$ to make
it more difficult. The difficulty is estimated qualitatively. It is
judged according to the friction coefficient between the contact
surfaces. Generally speaking, the friction coefficient between
lubricated surfaces is smaller than between dry surfaces, while
between smooth surfaces is smaller than between sticky
surfaces~\footnote{Precise value of friction coefficient between
  plastics varies by type of the plastic. According to an Internet
  resource~\citep{FOC}, the dry dynamic friction coefficient between
  plastic-plastic surface is 0.2-0.4 and the lubricated dynamic
  friction coefficient is 0.04-0.1.}. The $c1-c4$ are labeled by the increasing diameters of the caps.
  %JJB make this a citation and cite
  %it conventionally. URL citations need to include impression dates.


%By the increasing order of the friction, the bottles are labeled as $b1$, $b2$, $b3$, $b4$ (in order to enlarge the variance of the friction coefficients, we put lubricant to the bottle $b1$ and rough the contact surface between the bottle and the cap of $b4$). By the increasing order of the diameters of the caps, they are labeled as $c1$, $c2$, $c3$ and $c4$.

%JJB you need to learn the difference between "effecting" and
%"affecting", and "effect" and "affect".
We chose to vary the setups in surface condition and cap size as these
are the main points of variation between the different bottles
affecting the control strategy. The intention is to see how these two
variables affect human behaviour. To this end, we combine the bottles
and the caps by mounting the caps $c1-c4$ onto the `actual'
(manufactured) caps of the bottles (Figure~\ref{fig:setup}). To
investigate the effects of different caps and different bottles
separately, we conducted two groups of demonstrations: a fixed bottle with
four different caps ($b3c1, b3c2, b3c3, b3c4$) and a fixed cap with four
different bottles ($b1c3, b2c3, b3c3, b4c3$). Demonstrations on the
first group allow us to explore human grasping strategies with
different cap sizes. Demonstrations on the second group allow us to
explore human control strategies in adapting to different bottle
conditions. In total, we have seven different setups for the human
demonstration (Table~\ref{tab:bottlesandcaps}).

\label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sensors}
\label{sec:sensor}
In each setup the demonstrator demonstrates the task of opening bottle
cap three times. Before each demonstration, the bottle is tighten with
the cap with the same scale of tightness. In total we recorded 21~sets
of demonstrations. In this section, we the sensor recording of these
demonstrations.


As explained in section~\ref{sec:objectlevel}, we focus on the tuple
$\{\tau,F,s\}$ of the task. Three different sets of sensors are used in
the experiment to capture them:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Force torque sensor\footnote{https://www.ati-ia.com/} for exerted torque ($\tau$);
\item OptiTrack\footnote{http://www.naturalpoint.com/optitrack/} for cap displacement ($s$);
\item Tekscan\footnote{http://www.tekscan.com/} for exerted force ($F$).
\end{enumerate}

Data from these three sensors stream from three different
channels. Due to hardware limitations, the raw data steam from the
different channels does not come at the same time, and cannot be
recorded at a regular frequency. To synchronize the data, we produce a
synchronization signal at the beginning of each demonstration: the
demonstrator taps on the cap three times. The movement of the hand and
impulses on the cap produce simultaneous pulses in all three
channels. After recording, the data from the different channels is
synchronized by aligning the synchronization signal.

%JJB again, you should cite the sensors & robots --- Other papers leave them as footnote
%http://support.wolfram.com/kb/472
%http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3587/how-can-i-use-bibtex-to-cite-a-web-page
%http://superuser.com/questions/8743/how-to-cite-software-in-latex

In this task, the turning torque is the essential variable. This is
measured and recorded by an ATI force torque sensor. It is mounted
between the bottle and the cap (Figure~\ref{fig:setup}). During the
task, the demonstrator grasps the cap on the top of the force-torque
sensor and applies torque to open the bottle mounted below the
sensor. As the bottle is fixed to the table, the movement of the cap
is restricted to the rotation along the bottle's axis. Under the
approximation of zero angular momentum, the reading of the sensor
shows the force and torque applied to the cap. Besides the torque,
force applied to the z-axis direction is also recorded for the purpose
of synchronization (Section~\ref{dataanalysis}).

We track the displacement of the cap by a motion tracking system
OptiTrack. The OptiTrack system tracks movement by the infrared
reflecting markers attached to the object. In order to avoid obstacle
of the demonstration, we attach markers to a stick, which is fixed to
the cap from one end and the other end coming out from the bottom of
the bottle (Figure~\ref{fig:setup}). We also recorded the human hand
movements, by tracking markers attached to the human's hand. The
movement of the human hand is used later for synchronization
(Section~\ref{dataanalysis}).

% "covert" is very different from "cover".  The purpose of the . in
% "Figure." is to show that "Fig" is abbreviated from "Figure".  "Figure."
% makes no sense (except at the end of a sentence.)
During the task, the human also applies grip force on the cap in order
to grasp it firmly for turning. This force cannot be sensed by the
force torque sensor. Therefore, we used a pressure sensor (Tekscan
Grip System) for measuring the grip force. The Tekscan Grip System is
a flexible tactile pressure sensor that can be built into a glove. It
has 18~patches of sensors to cover the human's hand's front
surface. For manipulation, humans use not only the front surface, but
also the side surface of our fingers. In order to measure the force
applied by those surfaces, we mount two sets of Tekscan Grip System
sensors onto a glove to cover also the side surfaces
(Section.~\ref{ftsensor}). The method of mounting the sensors to the glove
is detailed in~\citep{deSouza2014}. With different sizes of the caps
or in different stages of the task, the way a human grasps the cap may
vary.  For example, a human may use two fingers to grip the smallest
cap~$c1$, and four fingers to grip the biggest cap~$c4$. The patches
receiving contact in each grasp are recorded. In the computation of
the total grip force, only the patches used are taken into
account. All patches are calibrated to give readings in the unit of
$N{\cdot}m$.


\subsection{Data Analysis}
\label{dataanalysis}
% Data: how to compute the cap displacement. Hand position. compute
% contact force. Figure of tekscan!!
In this section we explain how we manage the raw data and extra
training data.  The raw data from the three sensors streams is in
three separate channels. Each stream has a different format and hence
is handled differently.

\paragraph{\textbf{Exerted torque}}
\label{ftsensor}
As the movement of the cap is restricted to rotation around the
z-axis, we are concerned only with the torque applied in this direction.
% (Figure~\ref{fig:ftsensor}).
Another dimension of concern is the force applied in the z direction. The
three taps on the cap before each demonstration will create three
pulses in the z direction and hence is used for synchronization.


\paragraph{\textbf{Object displacement}}
\label{sec:optiktrack}
%With 3 markers attached with the object, OptiTrack is able to track both the object's translation and rotation. This is
From the OptiTrack, the cap's displacement is originally expressed in
the position vector and the rotation matrix. The angular
displacement of the cap is computed by the rotation matrix of the cap, and
the hand movement by the position vector of the hand. The accumulated
angular displacement is used to learn the model and the hand movement
is used to synchronize the data. % (Figure~\ref{fig:optitrack}).

\paragraph{\textbf{Grip Force}}
\label{tekscan}
As mentioned in previous section, we used two sets of Tekscan to cover
the front and the side of the human hand. This enables the
demonstrator to use any grasp they like for the task --- the human was
not restricted to using just two or three fingers as is the case in
most other grasping experiments. For each type of grasp, the reading
from the patches contacting with the cap are summed and multiplied by
their surface area to compute the total grip force. % (Figure~\ref{fig:ftsensor}).

Data from these three channels is synchronized by aligning the
synchronization pulses. The time of the last detected pulse is set as
the zero-reference point. \textcolor{red}{After synchronization we re-sample all the
temporal sequences to 1000Hz. Thus each single data point is
synchronized. Finally, we filter the noise by a low pass
filter (200Hz).} Figure~\ref{fig:3channels} shows an example of the data from
three different channels.

      significantly different from phase II}
}
\label{fig:3channels}
\end{figure}

% Only turning cycle
In this task we focus on the turning stage of each cycle. More
specifically, we focus on the data starting from the moment that the
fingers contact the cap and ending at the moment that the turning is
finished and the cap is released. The reaching and releasing cycles do
not involve contact with the environment and hence are not addressed
here.
% segmentation is not our job
% JJB "signal" is very different from "single"
In order to collect data from only the turning cycles, we trim the
data by the contact signal: only parts of the sequence with non-zero
contact force will be kept.\footnote{In this task the segmentation is
  done manually. The data can also be segmented by other algorithms
  but here we do not focus on task segmentation.} The trimmed
sequences are labeled by their associated equipment setup and the
order in which they occur, e.g. the first cycle of the bottle~1 with
cap~3 is labeled by $b1c3\_1$.

As can be seem from Figure~\ref{fig:3channels}, there are dramatic
difference between cycle one (the first cycle) and the rest of the
cycles: the exerted force and torque are much higher in the first
cycle. This is caused by the difference between the static friction
and the kinetic friction of the bottles. At the beginning of the task
we have to first break the contact between the bottle and the cap. The
friction we need to break at this stage is determined by the
static~FCO. Once the cap starts to move, the FCO between bottle and
cap transitions to kinetic~FCO, which is usually smaller than the
static~FCO for the same surface conditions. As a result, the torque and
hence the grip force required to turn the cap decreases in the later
cycles. This phenomenon implies that at lease two modules are needed
for this task. In the later section we will discuss these two phases
separately and referring the cycle one as ``phase I'' and the later cycles
as ``phase II''.
%JJB you need to mention this in the methods
%section under ``modular decomposition'', and then give a reference to
%this fuller description.  It is {\em not} OK to say you are telling
%the full story of the decomposition and then launch another level in
%another section. %JJB

In different demonstrations, the number of cycles used to open the cap is different, varying from four to six. The pattern of the later
cycles are similar as the demonstrator just repeats the same strategy for rotating the cap. For training, we take the first four cycles from each of the demonstrations. As mentioned above, human demonstrate the task in seven different setups, each for three times. This results in 84~time series in total for the learning.

%% what was recorded
%In each demonstration, data from first time the hand grab the cap to the cap is finally open and lifted, was record. Opening bottle cap is a cyclic task, each cycle of which includes reaching, turning and releasing stages. Depending on the tightness of the cap, a few cycles need to be done before the bottle is open. In this task we focus on the turning stage of each cycle, which start from the time that the fingers contact the cap and end at the moment that the turning is finished and the cap is released. During the turning cycles, force and torque are applied to the cap in order to break it's contact with the the bottle and the dynamics of the system changes diametrically. Our goal is to learn a model to encode human's strategy to cope with the abruptly changing environment during the turning cycle. The reaching and releasing cycles do not involve contact with the environment and hence we omit them.







\subsection{Learning Modules}
\label{learning}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item First hierarchical clustering \ldots
%  \item Find out number of models \ldots
%  \item Second build GMM for each of the model \ldots
%\end{itemize}

In this section, we explain how we encoded the training data into just
a few different modules. As explained in Section~\ref{sec:learn}, the
first step is to cluster the data and find out the number of modules
required in this task.

\subsubsection{Data clustering}
To cluster the 84 time series $Q\{s,\tau,F\}$ obtained from human
demonstration, we first compute the distance between each pair of
series by the DTW technique. As this task is time independent,
``warping'' of the data in the dimension of time does not affect the
control policy encoded in the time series. The distances between each
pair of the time series is shown in the heatmap
(Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap}). As can be observed from the heatmap, the
trials with the same setup and in the same cycle are very similar to
each other. Hence we regard these trials representing the same control
strategy and use their variance as the threshold of the
clustering. \textcolor{red}{Trails with distance less than this threshold are considered to be in the same cluster. This is to say, our clustering is based on the assumption that trials with the same setup and in the same cycle are governed by the same control strategy. This assumption help us further cluster the large amount of data to a small number of groups.} From this heatmap we can also see that within the same
cycle, the trials with the same bottle but with different caps,
e.g. $b3c1, b3c3$ and $b3c4$, are similar to each other. In the first
cycle, the trials with the same cap but with different bottles,
e.g. $b1c3, b2c3, b3c3$ and $b4c3$, are significantly different from
each other. In the later cycles, this difference decreases
gradually. This result shows that in the opening-bottle-cap task, the
surface condition between the bottle and the cap plays an important
role in the control strategy, while the role of cap size is relatively
minor. Figure~\ref{fig:cappatterns} shows three trials of opening
bottle $b2$ with different sizes of caps. It can be seen that their
patterns are similar.

As mentioned before, the demonstration of each setup is repeated three
times. Those three time series from the same setup and same cycle are presumed to
belong to the same group. To set a threshold for clustering, we
check the distances between the three time series in the same group. The largest distance we found is 0.04
(normalized) from the $b3c2$ phase~4. We add a $10\%$ margin on this
(resulting to 0.044) and use it as the threshold of
clustering. Time-series distances less than the threshold are grouped
into the same cluster. We use hierarchical agglomerative
clustering (Section~\ref{sec:cluster}) to merge the data into
fewer clusters. After five mergings, the clusters are no longer
mergeable and three clusters remains.

These three clusters contain the data from:

\begin{enumerate}
\item phase I of $b4c3$ (most difficult bottle), 3 time series;
\item phase I of $b3c1, b3c2, b3c3, b3c4, b2c3$ and phase II of $b4c3$, 24 time series;
\item phase I of $b1c3$ (easiest bottle) and phase II of the other setups, 57 time series.
\end{enumerate}

The result of clustering is shown in Table~\ref{tab:cluster}. This
result suggests that humans use three different strategies for opening
bottles: one for handling phase~I of the most difficult bottle with
adhesive materials on the bottle and cap surfaces; one for handling
phase~I of most bottles and phase~II of the most difficult bottle; and
one for handling phase~I of the lubricated bottle and phase~II of the
other bottles. The size of the cap turns out to be play a less
important role in the control strategies. According to these results, we
encode these three clusters separately.

\subsubsection{Learning Modules}
\label{sec:module}
We encode the data in each of the modules by means of GMM. As
explained in Section~\ref{sec:model}, a forward model and an inverse
model are built for each module. The forward model is encoded by the
joint distribution $p\{s_t,s_{t-1},a_{t-1}\mid\Omega_F\}$, while the
inverse model is encoded by
$p\{s_t,s{t+1},a_t,a_{t-1}\mid\Omega_I\}$. For each model, the number
of Gaussians is determined by the Bayesian information criterion
(BIC). We use 25 Gaussian for cluster 1, 40 for cluster 2 and 15 for
cluster 3. The BIC tests for each module / cluster are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:bic}.

\subsection{Generating robot motor commands for manipulation}
\label{sec:command}
Our approach is independent of robot system and can potentially be
applied to any robot. We chose to implement this work with a Barrett
hand mounted on a KUKA lightweight robot as these were available in
our lab. We implemented the multiple module system on this platform to
enable the robot to open bottle caps.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Control Algorithm}

        \State REACHING();

  \end{algorithmic}
  \label{code:control}
\end{algorithm}


In this experiment, we control the wrist joint (last joint of the KUKA)
for producing torque to turn the bottle cap. A force torque sensor is
fixed under the bottle to provide torque feedback. Each finger of the
Barrett hand is mounted with a
$Syntouch$\footnote{http://www.syntouchllc.com/} tactile sensor, which
is calibrated to provide contact force information, for the grip force
feedback. The cap displacement is measured by the wrist joint
displacement, assuming that there is no slippage between the fingers and
the cap.

The target bottle is fixed on the top of a table with its cap
tighten. The robot is placed above it at a distance that allows a
proper grasp on the cap. The Barrett hand then closes the fingers until
the bottle cap is touched. This position is recorded as the initial
position, where the cap displacement is marked as zero. In the
experiment we focus on the turning cycle. The releasing and reaching
cycles are programmed by opening the fingers and restoring to the
initial position. \textcolor{red}{ The information gathered from the Tekscan during the demonstrations is transferred to the Syntouch and used to guide the grip force. During the process, the tactile sensors are used to ensure the fingers are touching the cap and providing enough grip force to avoid slide between the hand and the cap.}

% JJB check:  I added the lambdas in here to reference back to
% equation 10.   Check that this makes sense?
We first tested the model with the trained bottles and then with two
new bottles. With each bottle, the turning-releasing-restoring cycles
are repeated four times. Data streams from the sensors are filtered to
$100Hz$. Once the turning cycle starts, the forward models take the
torque and displacement at the last time step as input, compute the
expected displacement of the current time step. These expected
displacements are compared with the actual displacement measured at
the sensor to evaluate the reliability, expressed as a normalized
responsibility factor ($\lambda_t^k$), of each module ($k$). The inverse models
take the current displacement, desired next displacement, and the
previous torque as input to compute the a proper action
(torque) to take on the cap. Each of the three outputs is weighted by
multiplied with its responsibility factor, and the final output is the sum of the three weighted outputs (Algorithm~\ref{code:control}).

In the process of implementation on a real robot, we found that
without putting any restriction of the responsibility factor, it can
change very rapidly. This is caused by the environmental noise in the
sensory input and results in instability of the control system. We
therefore apply a low-pass filter \textcolor{red}{(100 Hz)} on the responsibility factor
$\lambda_t^k$ to reduce the fluctuation. \textcolor{red}{This filtering implies that
the real dynamics do not switch back and forth with high frequency, which is consistent
with the character of our task.} %(Figure~\ref{fig:rf}).

% "lag" is not "slag"
Before applying the final output on the robot, a compensational torque is added to it in order to compensate the lag causing by the distortion of the robot hand during turning. The control algorithm described above is shown in algorithm~\ref{code:control}.


\subsection{Experiment results}


% TODO:
% 1) explain whether the use of the clusters correspond to your expectations and really relate to an identification of different phases
% 2) what the novel object consist of, in what do they differ from the other objects

% 4) Do the results match your expectations

%We implement this algorithm with two bottles (b1 and b4) in the training set and then two bottles (b5 and b6) had not been used for training.
We validated the algorithm to control cap opening in our robot. We
first tested the ability of the system to open 2 of the bottles seen
during training ($b1$ and $b4$). We then tested the generalization
capacity of the system by opening two bottles ($b5$ and $b6$) not seen
during training.  Bottle $b1$ and $b4$ are the easiest and most difficult
bottle to open in the training set.  Bottle $b5$ is a large bottle,
which is hard for human to grasp and open. Bottle $b6$ is a glass bottle
with a plastic cap. The surface interaction between these two
materials had not been demonstrated. As the Barrett hand is
significantly larger than a human hand, $b1, b4, b6$ are mounted with
$c5$ (the cap of $b5$ with diameter $110 mm$) on the top to ensure a
firm grasp. In total, four different setups were used in the
experiment: $b1c5, b4c5, b5c5$ and $b6c5$. As discuss above, the size
of the cap has minor effect on the control strategy. Therefore we
expected the setups $b1c5$ and $b4c5$ to result in similar behavior as
those of $b1c3$ and $b4c3$ in the training. The experimental results
and demonstration snapshots are shown in
figures~\ref{fig:demo_b1}-~\ref{fig:demo_b6}~\footnote{Demonstration
  videos are available at http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~bh325/opencap.rar
  and will be provided as an electronic supplement to the
  article.}. Figure~\ref{fig:demo_b1b4b5b6} is a similar plot to the
figure from the demonstration, figure~\ref{fig:bottlepatterns}, which
aligns the exerted torque of the four experiments. %JJB check all the
                                %above is OK. JJB

In each experiment we record the cap displacement, exerted torque, and
the responsibility factors of all three modules. Bottle $b1$ is the
easiest bottle to open in the training set, the control policies of
both phase~I and phase~II are grouped into cluster~3. As a result,
in the $b1$ experiment, module~3 takes most of the responsibility
(Figure~\ref{fig:demo_b1}).

%its != it's.  It's is also informal and never occurs in academic papers.
Bottle $b4$ is the most difficult bottle to open in the training set
and its phase~I requires more than $3Nm$
(Figure~\ref{fig:bottlepatterns}). Due to the smooth contact surfaces
between the Barrett hand and the cap, it is difficult to apply $3Nm$
torque to the cap without slipping. To avoid damaging the robot, we
tested $b4$ phase~II only: the cap is loosely screwed on the
bottle. Without knowing this, in the experiment the robot is able to
properly estimate the current task context. As can be seen from the
figure~\ref{fig:demo_b4}, which is different from $b1$, the dominant
module is module~2 which corresponds to  $b4$, phase~II. This
performance would be hard to achieved with a deterministic system based
on expected values for friction coefficients.

Bottle $b5$ is a novel one but is made of a similar material (plastic) to
the training bottles. A very similar torque profile to $b2$ and $b3$ is
generated for $b5$: phase~I is sharp, while phase~II is flatter and
significantly smaller than phase~I ($b2$:
Figure~\ref{fig:bottlepatterns}, $b3$: Figure~\ref{fig:cappatterns},
$b5$: Figure~\ref{fig:demo_b5}). This is because $b5$ has a dry contact
surface as $b2$ and $b3$, and $b1$ is lubricated and $b4$ is attached with
a sticky material, honey.

Bottle $b6$ is also a novel one but with novel surface materials
(plastic and glass)\footnote{A common way of measuring the FCO of a
  material is measuring it against metal: the static FCO between glass
  and metal is 0.5--0.7, while between two polythene and steel is
  around 0.2. This implies that the plastic and glass are indeed very
  different in FCO. There is not a universal measurement of the FOC
  between plastic and glass.}. Its torque profile is different from
what we observed in training set. Despite this, $b6$ is opened with this
torque profile generated by the three learnt modules.

\textcolor{red}{In these experiments, the robot always choose to use the combination of modules. At one hand, this is because of the variance of the forward models. The variance of a GMM represents the variance of the training data, i.e. human demonstrations, and a GMM can have locally large variance.
In our approach, each GMM is learned independently, without knowing the boundaries of other modules. This can result in a GMM having non-zero probability at the borders of other modules. At the other hand, more importantly, the way we compute the responsibility factor is one that encourages more cooperation between modules. In this way, we can generalise better to novel task contexts, as more modules will contribute to generate new motor commands. As can be seen from the results, our method can generate commands properly to accomplish the task in both trained and novel task contexts. Other ways of computing the responsibility factor that bring less cooperation may cause instability when generalise to new task contexts. }


With the above four different setups, the modular model adapts
accordingly and successfully generates torque commands to open the
bottles. Successful cap opening is achieve when the cap is unscrewed
far enough that it can be lifted up. Though no prior information is
provided about the bottles, the task contexts are properly estimated
and ``contextualized'' motor commands are generated to unscrew the
caps. These experiments show that our multiple modular approach is
indeed effective in manipulation tasks.
