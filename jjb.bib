Viewing model building as exactly theory building demands more rigor from the models while simultaneously facilitating the scientific process in novel ways. The discussion section we provide (‘‘Recalibrating the DMR Theory’’) is intended to contribute not only to the DMR theory but also methodologically to the scientific application of ABM, by demonstrating good practice in model outcome communication and by validating through demonstration the model-as-theory approach." p219  Also a good discussion of what's wrong with overly-cognitive or detailed models on p. 220.  e.g. "This is why the primary goal of Model 1 has been to use ABMs as a way of examining the internal consistency of our theories. In contrast, Model 2 looks at long-term dynamics, and therefore is a far simpler model of religion and agents. Both models are hybrids, which look at the dynamic functioning of features of a system both in place and over time, but each has different emphases in order to allow detailed exploration of different parts of the problem.  By standard scientific practice a model/theory should only be exactly as complex as necessary to simulate/explain the phenomenon it intends to address. Some of our commentators seem uncomfortable with this basic aspect of scientific method. "  and on 223 "These encouraging and constructive extensions to our models even in the brief period allowed for the preparation of commentaries demonstrate the utility of scientific communication through open-source model sharing." }

abstract = "Pro-social punishment, whereby cooperators punish defectors, is often suggested as a mechanism that maintains cooperation in large human groups. Importantly, models that support this idea have to date only allowed defectors to be the target of punishment. However, recent empirical work has demonstrated the existence of anti-social punishment in public goods games. That is, individuals that defect have been found to also punish cooperators. Some recent theoretical studies have found that such anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation. However, the evolution of anti-social punishment in group-structured populations has not been formally addressed. Previous work has informally argued that group-structure must favour pro-social punishment. Here we formally investigate how two demographic factors, group size and dispersal frequency, affect selection pressures on pro- and anti-social punishment. Contrary to the suggestions of previous work, we find that anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation under a range of group structures. Given that anti-social punishment has now been found in all studied extant human cultures, the claims of previous models showing the co-evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation in group-structured populations should be re-evaluated."

By reviewing the nature of human intelligence, this article shows that an individual's memory and ideas cannot operate directly without the human body in which they were developed. Further, there is no meaningful way in which technology can allow indefinite access to our culture. However, our lives and actions do influence the thoughts and actions of those who are living, and the Internet can enhance this influence even after our death. }

abstract = {This article argues that conscious attention exists not so much for selecting an immediate action as for using the current task to focus specialized learning for the action-selection mechanism(s) and predictive models on tasks and environmental contingencies likely to affect the conscious agent. It is perfectly possible to build this sort of a system into machine intelligence, but it would not be strictly necessary unless the intelligence needs to learn and is resource-bounded with respect to the rate of learning versus the rate of relevant environmental change. Support for this theory is drawn from scientific research and AI simulations. Consequences are discussed with respect to self-consciousness and ethical obligations to and for AI.
